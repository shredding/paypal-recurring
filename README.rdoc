= PayPal Recurring Billing

PayPal Express Checkout API Client for recurring billing. A modified version based on fnando/paypal-recurring

== Installation

  In your Gemfile, add gem 'paypal-recurring', :git => 'git://github.com/fredxinfan/paypal-recurring.git'

== Usage

First, you need to set up your credentials:

  require "paypal/recurring"

  PayPal::Recurring.configure do |config|
    # config.sandbox = true
    config.username = "seller_1308793919_biz_api1.simplesideias.com.br"
    config.password = "1308793931"
    config.application_id = "APP-YOURAPPIDHERE"
    config.signature = "AFcWxV21C7fd0v3bYYYRCpSSRl31AzaB6TzXx5amObyEghjU13.0av2Y"
  end

If you are using paypal certificate:
  
  PayPal::Recurring.configure do |config|
    # config.sandbox = true
    config.username = "seller_1308793919_biz_api1.simplesideias.com.br"
    config.password = "1308793931"
    config.application_id = "APP-YOURAPPIDHERE"
    config.ssl_cert = "/path/to/cert_key_pem.txt"
  end

Then, you can request a new payment authorization:

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new({
    :return_url   => "http://example.com/paypal/thank_you",
    :cancel_url   => "http://example.com/paypal/canceled",
    :ipn_url      => "http://example.com/paypal/ipn",
    :description  => "Awesome - Monthly Subscription",
    :amount       => "9.00",
    :currency     => "USD"
  })

If you request a payment on behalf of a third party:

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new({
    :return_url   => "http://example.com/paypal/thank_you",
    :cancel_url   => "http://example.com/paypal/canceled",
    :ipn_url      => "http://example.com/paypal/ipn",
    :description  => "Awesome - Monthly Subscription",
    :amount       => "9.00",
    :subject      => "thirdparty@emailaddress.com",
    :currency     => "USD"
  })
	
You also need to add "X-PAYPAL-AUTHORIZATION" header in your third party API call. Generate "X-PAYPAL-AUTHORIZATION" header by using this gem https://github.com/fx83060856/paypal-permissions.git

  response = ppr.checkout
  puts response.checkout_url if response.valid?

You need to redirect your user to the url returned by <tt>response.checkout_url</tt>.
After the user accepts or rejects your payment request, he will be redirected to one of those urls you specified.
The return url will receive two parameters: <tt>PAYERID</tt> and <tt>TOKEN</tt>. You can use the <tt>TOKEN</tt>
parameter to identify your user on your database.

If you need to retrieve information about your buyer, like address or e-mail, you can use the
<tt>checkout_details()</tt> method.

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new(:token => "EC-05C46042TU8306821")
  response = ppr.checkout_details

Now, you need to request payment. The information you provide here should be exactly the same when you started
the checkout process.

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new({
    :token       => "EC-05C46042TU8306821",
    :payer_id    => "WTTS5KC2T46YU",
    :amount      => "9.00",
    :description => "Awesome - Monthly Subscription"
  })
  response = ppr.request_payment
  response.approved?
  response.completed?

Finally, you need to create a new recurring profile.

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new({
    :amount      => "9.00",
    :currency    => "USD",
    :description => "Awesome - Monthly Subscription",
    :ipn_url     => "http://example.com/paypal/ipn",
    :frequency   => 1,
    :token       => "EC-05C46042TU8306821",
    :period      => :monthly,
    :reference   => "1234",
    :payer_id    => "WTTS5KC2T46YU",
    :start_at    => Time.now,
    :failed      => 1,
    :outstanding => :next_billing
  })

  response = ppr.create_recurring_profile
  puts response.profile_id

(Optionally) You can specify a trial period, frequency, and length.

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new({
    :amount          => "9.00",
    :currency        => "USD",
    :description     => "Awesome - Monthly Subscription",
    :ipn_url         => "http://example.com/paypal/ipn",
    :frequency       => 1,
    :token           => "EC-05C46042TU8306821",
    :period          => :monthly,
    :reference       => "1234",
    :payer_id        => "WTTS5KC2T46YU",
    :start_at        => Time.now,
    :failed          => 1,
    :outstanding     => :next_billing,
    :trial_length    => 1,
    :trial_period    => :monthly,
    :trial_frequency => 1
  })

You can manage your recurring profile.

  ppr = PayPal::Recurring.new(:profile_id => "I-VCEL6TRG35CU")

  ppr.suspend
  ppr.reactivate
  ppr.cancel

=== What information do I need to keep?

You should save two paramaters to your database: <tt>TOKEN</tt> and <tt>PROFILEID</tt>.
<tt>TOKEN</tt> is required when user returns to your website after he authorizes (or not) the billing process. You
need to save it so you can find him later. You can remove this info after payment and recurring profile are set.

The <tt>PROFILEID</tt> allows you to manage the recurring profile, like cancelling billing when an user don't
want to use your service anymore.

<b>NOTE:</b> TOKEN will expire after approximately 3 hours.
